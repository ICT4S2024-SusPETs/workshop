    <h2>Call for papers</h2>
    <p>
        We invite researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to participate in our half-day workshop exploring the intersection of Privacy-Enhancing Techniques (PETs) with sustainability challenges.
        As the volume of Artificial Intelligence (AI) publications skyrockets, it's imperative to address the ecological impact.
        Early studies warned of environmental repercussions, emphasizing the need for a nuanced analysis of digital processes and their ecological footprint.
        Our workshop delves into two critical aspects of PETs, namely: energy consumption and data utility.
        We welcome researchers to submit their papers on the following topics:
        <ul>
            <li>Synthetic data;</li>
            <li>k-anonymity, l-diversity and t-closeness;</li>
            <li>Encryption;</li>
            <li>Privacy-preserving machine learning;</li>
            <li>Other privacy-enhancing techniques or practises.</li>
        </ul>

        Papers can be submitted via <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ict4s2024">EasyChair</a> and should be between up to pages long including references.

        We strive to have between 6-8 papers to be presented in our workshop, after which we discuss the outcomes in a group of peers.
        More info on the <a href="program">programme</a> can be found on the website.
