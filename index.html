    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Besides many benefits, ICT also brings societal challenges such as climate change and privacy concerns.
        With the amount of publications on Artificial Intelligence (AI) has increasing more than fivefold over the last decade [1], we should consider ICT’s share in the energy consumption.
        Early studies already warned of the dangers of using digitalisation without rebound considerations regarding the environment [2] and identified the need for a more finegrained analysis of digital processes with respect to their
ecological footprint [3]. Recent work states ICT’s carbon
footprint is substantive, except if renewable energy is used,
and will continue to rise in the future in step with the
growth of the digital economy [4], optimizing the energy
consumption of data processing is imperative.
Apart from sustainability, there is growing concern about
privacy amongst citizens of all ages [5]. To ensure the
privacy of those whose data are collected the General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) has been adopted in Europe
in 2016. The GDPR regulates that all citizens in Europe have
control over their personal data [6]. There is one exception
to the GDPR; it does not apply to anonymised data. In
the GDPR, anonymous data is defined as: ”information
which does not relate to an identified or identifiable natural
person or to personal data rendered anonymous in such a
manner that the data subject is not or no longer identifiable.” [7]. And so, privacy-enhancing techniques (PETs)
as k-anonymity and synthetic data are increasingly used to
comply with privacy legislation.
For policymakers, weighing the potential and the shortcomings of PETs is crucial for policymakers and practitioners. Researchers can provide crucial insights to facilitate
informed decision-making [8]. This workshop addresses
these two aspects of privacy-enhancing techniques: energy
consumption and data utility. Earlier work examined the
impact of synthetic data and k-anonymity on the energy
consumption and accuracy of machine learning tasks [9],
[10], but was small scaled. To expand and generalise our
knowledge on PETs, we should decide on the research
direction for this field. Our workshop discusses current
practises and possibilities for future work, we hope to spark
new ICT4S papers on PETs.
